# MIDI2SwinSID
## Connect two SID emulators to a MIDI system

This repository contains the firmware of a STM32 project to connect two SwinSID's to a MIDI source. They are a popular hardware replacement for the well known SID device, the beloved sound chip of the Commodore 64.

The firmware is supposed to run on a STM32F429I-DISCO evaluation board.

This project is not very clean yet. I use a barebone approach with a simple editor and a makefile and everything is far from perfect.
For example, the schematic is not available yet here, as it is handwritten on my laboratory notebook.

Feel free to interact, if you are interested.
